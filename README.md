# Audio Braille Pattern

## Start with Why

My blind daughter likes doing [braille patterns](https://www.pathstoliteracy.org/strategies/just-fun-braille-designs) for fun, like love hearts, snowman, trucks ect. Unfortunately, we have to read the instructions to her which makes her feel very dependant.

In an attempt to change that, we created voice recordings with the braille pattern instructions. She loves the human voice, especially her mom's, instead of the robot screen-reader. 

This website will list all the audio braille patterns we've created with the hope other kids will enjoy it too.

Of course big kids(adults) are welcome too :smiley:.

Created with :heart: and have fun!
