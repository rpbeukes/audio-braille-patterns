# Audio Braille Patterns

## Why

My blind daughter likes doing [braille patterns](https://www.pathstoliteracy.org/strategies/just-fun-braille-designs) for fun. She creates love hearts, a snowman, trucks ect. Not only is this a fun activity, it also help with her braille literacy.

She is not really fond of screen-readers and we have to read the instructions to her, which makes her feel very dependant.

In an attempt to change that, we created voice recordings with the braille pattern instructions. She loves the human voice, especially her mom's, instead of the robot screen-reader. 

This website will list all the audio braille patterns voice recordings  we've created with the hope other kids will enjoy it too. Of course big kids(adults) are welcome too :smiley:.

This site is created with love for our blind community :heart:.

Have fun!
